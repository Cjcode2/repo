        <p>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Happy 2nd Anniversary baby, Over the past two years, 
       <br> we've faced many challenges, accompanied by a mix of emotions <br>sadness, 
        anger, joy, anxiety, and more. But I'm happy that we're still here together, 
        even when there were times we didn't understand each other. Despite that, 
        I love you more than words can express, and I hope you appreciate my efforts for you. <br>
        I love you so much, and Happy 2nd Anniversary!"</b>
